1. Run this Python script inside Blender (open it in "Text Editor" then click the "Run script" button).
2. Select all static objects you want to export.
3. File | Export | KishiTech - Static FBX Batch Export.
4. Set a directory to copy *.fbx files or leave the field empty to skip the copy step.
5. Done! *.fbx files will be saved in the same directory of your .blend file, using each object's name (and will be copied to the directory you defined in step 4, if not empty).
